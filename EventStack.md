Each node in a simulation has it's own event stack. The event stack as depicted below is a set of event handlers that perform the actual event processing within the framework. Each time the virtualized application accesses the intercepted API the invocations are wrapped within the _EventBridge_ into so-called _events_ that are passed to the _event stack_. The event stack invokes the event handler at the top to handle it. The event handler have the freedom to forward the event to the next lower or even to the next higher handler. They are also allowed to create new events and pass them up or down in the event stack. Once an event is send back to the event bridge the application's API invocation wakes up and returns the control flow.

An event handler can only access the state of the node owning the event stack and all assigned applications. Once the handler requires to communicate with other handler instances of other nodes it must make use of so-called _channels_. A channel is a FIFO topic managed by the framework. An event handler can subscribe to multiple channels at runtime and thereby communicate with other handlers subscribing to the same channel.
